Biography
======
Xusheng Zhang is currently pursuing a Master's degree at the School of Geospatial Engineering and Science, Sun Yat-sen University. He is a member of the 3D Information Acquisition and Processing team, focusing on research areas such as LiDAR SLAM, obstacle recognition，and extraction.

Main Research Focus:
======
1. LiDAR-Inertial based SLAM：
Utilizing Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data as prior information to construct a probabilistic 3D voxel map. Implementing real-time robot localization based on particle filter algorithm, optimizing laser odometry algorithm, integrating factor graph optimization to establish a laser SLAM framework suitable for unstructured environments, addressing the issue of trajectory drift during long-distance movements.
