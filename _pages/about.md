Biography
======
Xusheng Zhang is currently pursuing a Master's degree at the School of Geospatial Engineering and Science, Sun Yat-sen University. He is a member of the 3D Information Acquisition and Processing team, focusing on research areas such as LiDAR SLAM, obstacle recognition，and extraction.

Main Research Focus:
======
1. LiDAR-Inertial based SLAM：
Utilizing Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data as prior information to construct a probabilistic 3D voxel map. Implementing real-time robot localization based on particle filter algorithm, optimizing laser odometry algorithm, integrating factor graph optimization to establish a laser SLAM framework suitable for unstructured environments, addressing the issue of trajectory drift during long-distance movements.

2. Obstacle Recognition, and Extraction:
Identification and Detection of Obstacles (such as rocks, impact craters, steep slopes, etc.) in Lunar surface environment.

                                                                   ![003](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0bfe2bbf-c120-47b6-ade0-c7fc62ec001d)

                                                                                  Obstacle Recognition Test conducted on a field dataset.

                                                                   ![004](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/984d1b0c-be7b-4293-b905-3270098cb7d5)

                                                                                  Obstacle Recognition Test conducted in a city scenario.
